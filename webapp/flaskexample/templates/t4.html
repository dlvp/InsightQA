<p><font size="3"><a href="../t4_a1"> Q1 </a></font>: Does anyone know something about the deprecated method .inc(word) of nltk's FreqDist() function? In particular, I have heard that word_freq.inc(word) has to be replaced with word_freq[word] += 1, but what if there is a second variable (which is an integer), as in: word_degree.inc(word, degree)?</p><p><font size="3"><a href="../t4_a2"> Q2 </a></font>: Does anybody have experience with tf-idf or word2vec?</p><p><font size="3"><a href="../t4_a3"> Q3 </a></font>: Hello! Got a regex question: 
I have a block of text (including newlines). There are two keywords in this text (i.e.. 'Inclusion' and 'Exclusion') and I'd like to extract the text between each keyword and the next, or until the end of the string, whichever comes first. So far, I can succesfully extract the text when the keywords are (1) in order and (2) both present, (via `r"(?:inclusion)(?:.*)([\s\S]*)(?:exclusion)(?:.*)([\s\S]*)"`) but I'd like do this more generally. Any suggestions?</p><p><font size="3"><a href="../t4_a4"> Q4 </a></font>: !channel, particularly NLP folks: any suggestions on how I can incorporate specific keywords from comments (~7 - 150 characters in length) as features in a classification model? I've been thinking of TF-IDF but I can't figure out how to do this for specific keywords rather than all the possible words in a corpus.</p><p><font size="3"><a href="../t4_a5"> Q5 </a></font>: For all of you word2vec users: What is the method that you use to create a sentence vector from a word 2 vec model?</p><p><font size="3"><a href="../t4_a6"> Q6 </a></font>: Hey guys. What is your favorite methods for clustering word vectors (ala word2vec)?</p><p><font size="3"><a href="../t4_a7"> Q7 </a></font>: anyone with NLP knowledge also know something about word/phrase/sentence generation?</p><p><font size="3"><a href="../t4_a8"> Q8 </a></font>: hey all, any recommendations for a large text summarization dataset (paragraph -&gt; sentence)?</p><p><font size="3"><a href="../t4_a9"> Q9 </a></font>: Does anyone know which is a good library for generating fake data apart from faker in python</p><p><font size="3"><a href="../t4_a10"> Q10 </a></font>: Has anyone from our cohort focused on NLP? I'm trying to formulate an analysis but have little experience with unsupervised NLP methods. Essentially I want to determine if there is a significant difference between two groups in topics extracted from a short free response in a number of participants. Primary concerns is that there are fewer than 1k free responses, and most are on the order of 10-15 words, though some are a few paragraphs. Fortunately, the topics are highly focused and there are definitely common themes across most responses.</p><p><font size="3"><a href="../t4_a11"> Q11 </a></font>: Question from a current fellow here: I’m working on my web app. I have a text file of web addresses that I would like to read in and turn into clickable urls. However, my knowledge of flask/bootstrap/jquery is rudimentry and the other fellows here don’t know how to do it either. Could anyone here help me read a text document using jquery?</p>
