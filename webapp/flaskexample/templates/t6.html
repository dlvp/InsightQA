I will be referencing the following lecture slides from Duke http://people.duke.edu/~rnau/Slides_on_ARIMA_models--Robert_Nau.pdf by Robert Nau (Full page with very good detailed theories at http://people.duke.edu/~rnau/411arim3.htm), and also discussing a python example from https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/a-guide-to-time-series-forecasting-with-arima-in-python-3 by Thomas Vincent. Again, I picked this up not long ago so if anyone wants to join in to explain you are very welcomed!</p><p><font size="3"><a href="../t6_a5"> Q5 </a></font>: Anybody want to practice some behavioral interviewing today?</p><p><font size="3"><a href="../t6_a6"> Q6 </a></font>: Anyone know anyone that does time-series analysis? I would love to talk to them about it!</p><p><font size="3"><a href="../t6_a7"> Q7 </a></font>: has anyone worked with trying to detect anomalies in time series data, or, for example, trying to detect statistically significant differences in a metric across ~100 AB tests where you have daily measurements? #multiplecomparisonfun</p><p><font size="3"><a href="../t6_a8"> Q8 </a></font>: !here does anyone have experience applying GANs to problems other than image creation? I'm curious to hear about other applications. </p><p><font size="3"><a href="../t6_a9"> Q9 </a></font>: Does anyone have any examples of how to do time series histograms w/ time interval buckets?  Thank you! :bow:</p><p><font size="3"><a href="../t6_a10"> Q10 </a></font>: Does anyone in the Bay Area have Indian rupees they'd like to exchange with me? I'm heading to India soon for a trip.</p><p><font size="3"><a href="../t6_a11"> Q11 </a></font>: Does anyone know of a good time series on respiratory or cardiovascular health? Something like daily or weekly hospital admissions for asthma or heart attacks?

I’d like something with relatively fine spatial resolution (e.g. data on individual counties or smaller).</p>
