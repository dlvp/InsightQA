<p><font size="3"><a href="../t0_a1"> Q1 </a></font>: does anyone know of a good implementation or blogpost of “attention” neural networks in keras?</p><p><font size="3"><a href="../t0_a2"> Q2 </a></font>: Good morning guys. Any suggestions on what to do if a neural network is overfitting? Thanks!</p><p><font size="3"><a href="../t0_a3"> Q3 </a></font>: Does anybody know of a graphics-assisted way to do DL? I'm thinking a user interface that shows you an image of the neural network architecture and menus that would allow a user to fine-tune the model (ie. number of hidden units, activation function, etc. etc.).</p><p><font size="3"><a href="../t0_a4"> Q4 </a></font>: !here|@here hello again smart data scientists! does anyone want to explain parameter sharing with me?</p><p><font size="3"><a href="../t0_a5"> Q5 </a></font>: !here|@here: Hey smart data scientists! does someone want to explain rectified linear unit and the hidden layer to me?</p><p><font size="3"><a href="../t0_a6"> Q6 </a></font>: I’m getting a shape miss-match error from somewhere deep in a pretty complicated model (keras implementation). I was wondering if anyone had any tips-and-tricks for debugging this kind of thing? Unfortunately, printing out the model summery wasn’t helpful for this particular issue.</p><p><font size="3"><a href="../t0_a7"> Q7 </a></font>: Hi Guys, do any of you have good recommendations for tutorials on image classification using CNN in tensorflow/keras? There is a ton online, and I need to figure out where to start :slightly_smiling_face:</p><p><font size="3"><a href="../t0_a8"> Q8 </a></font>: Would any past fellows here have some expertise in building LSTMs in Keras or Tensorflow api?  Specifically anyone with experience in encoder / decoder architecture with word embeddings</p><p><font size="3"><a href="../t0_a9"> Q9 </a></font>: Can anyone shed some light on why Hadoop streaming would map and reduce my input perfectly when the input is in a single HDFS file, but the mappers output nothing when the input is split across multiple files?</p><p><font size="3"><a href="../t0_a10"> Q10 </a></font>: anyone take good notes for the uber talk? does anyone remember what the theoretical architecture was?</p><p><font size="3"><a href="../t0_a11"> Q11 </a></font>: Hello everyone! Has anybody had experience with Tensorflow. I want to figure out if use it or keras for my problem (My mentor softly isists on tesorflow)</p><p><font size="3"><a href="../t0_a12"> Q12 </a></font>: Anyone use word2vec for sentiment analysis? The tutorial on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/word2vec-nlp-tutorial) says they do as well as BOW. I saw this mentioned elsewhere too, so I'm wondering what's the point?</p><p><font size="3"><a href="../t0_a13"> Q13 </a></font>: @U5L80AFUM That sounds like a nice problem but difficult to do if you have little experience with deep learning. Keras is easier to use out of the box. I think staying with Keras would be much easier than using tensorflow (Its API is kinda confusing and the documentation isn't the best). I'm no expert on convolutional networks (or any aspect of anns for that matter). However, there are models that have been trained for 3d convolution (i.e. videos). I think that those models are present on Keras as well.</p>
