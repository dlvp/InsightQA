<p><font size="3"><a href="../t3_a1"> Q1 </a></font>: Stats models question. I'm trying to use ARMA and enter a range of dates, mine are in the form year-month-day and I am having troubling using their dates_from_range which appears to only take years or quarters. Anyone with experience in this?</p><p><font size="3"><a href="../t3_a2"> Q2 </a></font>: ok, so i've got two _categorical_ features which i suspect are highly related or even overlapping, and i'm trying to figure out how to test that.  i'm imagining a 2D histogram with one feature on each axis and the color encoding the count of inputs in each bin.  is there an easy way to do this without encoding the categorical variables into numerical ones?  my google-fu is failing me...</p><p><font size="3"><a href="../t3_a3"> Q3 </a></font>: Can anyone tell me what is the most common way to  calculate correlation matrix using scikit learn? It seems there are multiple choices.</p><p><font size="3"><a href="../t3_a4"> Q4 </a></font>: Does anyone have experience loading a .tsv file format into python and then looking at it? The stack overflow feedback was not helpful to me. I am the panicked looking one in the back. :grimacing:</p><p><font size="3"><a href="../t3_a5"> Q5 </a></font>: I am uploading my raw data to SQL from a csv file. Before I can do that I need to create a table with all the column headings. Since my data has many columns (50), this is a super time consuming operation (and prone to mistakes). Does anybody know if one can avoid that and use the column headings from the csv file?</p><p><font size="3"><a href="../t3_a6"> Q6 </a></font>: Does anyone have any tips about getting a unicode data frame in pandas (collected through webscraping) into mysql? I have a function that uses sqlalchemy and pymysql which works, but not for this dataframe in particular. I've tried a number of data type conversions, but can't seem to get anything to work. Looking for any kind of work around, I only need to get one df with 10 or so columns into mysql. Thanks!</p><p><font size="3"><a href="../t3_a7"> Q7 </a></font>: Has anyone gotten this error when inserting a pandas data frame into MySQL: ValueError: duplicate name in index/columns: cannot insert athlete, already exists? I don't think I have any duplicate lines or indices.</p><p><font size="3"><a href="../t3_a8"> Q8 </a></font>: Anyone have experience with datetime? I’m trying to calculate age from DOB and it refuses to work via multiple approaches</p><p><font size="3"><a href="../t3_a9"> Q9 </a></font>: Hi all! I'm stumped by a seemingly simple sql question (I'm using SQLite in Python) I'm looking to join the date column in one table to the nearest less than date column of another table.  Thanks!</p><p><font size="3"><a href="../t3_a10"> Q10 </a></font>: anyone have experience with tensorflow?</p><p><font size="3"><a href="../t3_a11"> Q11 </a></font>: I basically always use Pandas Dataframes (but I don't deal with enough data to need Spark). Most of the other formats I need to interact with I can convert with Pandas functionality (e.g. Dataframe.to_csv). In some cases I need to build a helper function (e.g. a function I'll pass to Series.map), but I use Pandas and numpy as much as possible so I don't reinvent many wheels</p><p><font size="3"><a href="../t3_a12"> Q12 </a></font>: does anyone have a pipeline for converting sql to csv yet? i'm running into issues converting mimic data</p><p><font size="3"><a href="../t3_a13"> Q13 </a></font>: does anyone know how to bin over custom time ranges in pandas?</p>
