Any suggestions?</p><p><font size="3"><a href="../t7_a3"> Q3 </a></font>: Anyone have experience with using DBSCAN for outlier detection?

If so, let me know, we can team up :slightly_smiling_face:</p><p><font size="3"><a href="../t7_a5"> Q5 </a></font>: does anyone know if there is an easy way to change the distance metrics in sklearn classifiers?</p><p><font size="3"><a href="../t7_a6"> Q6 </a></font>: anyone else using cosine similarity and have a second?</p><p><font size="3"><a href="../t7_a7"> Q7 </a></font>: did anyone else run into a similar problem with ec2spinup:

I'm having moderate success with the typical approach of agglomerative clustering, GMMs, and structured perceptron. Would love to talk details with someone who has some experience though.</p><p><font size="3"><a href="../t7_a9"> Q9 </a></font>: Hi All, 
Need some insights from clustering experts here !
I am trying to find clusters in a dataset that has latitude-longitude as two of the features - I found that DBscan works well for lat-lon data - but does it work for lat_lon + other features (mostly categorical)?  Or should I try something else?
Thanks in advance for any pointers!</p><p><font size="3"><a href="../t7_a10"> Q10 </a></font>: Does anyone know how to group features in the correlation matrix? something similar to what we saw in Faye's presentation</p><p><font size="3"><a href="../t7_a11"> Q11 </a></font>: Hey guys. What is your favorite methods for clustering word vectors (ala word2vec)?</p><p><font size="3"><a href="../t7_a12"> Q12 </a></font>: Hi all, I am trying to find a clustering technique (in python) than can work with very large data set (about one million samples, 10-20 features), small 3-5 number of possibly uneven clusters. Any help would be appreciated. 
I tried DBSCAN and Aghromerative clustering, but I get memory problem, or they are too slow. </p><p><font size="3"><a href="../t7_a13"> Q13 </a></font>: Up to now, i am able to read 80G file and can do some basic command. rdd.first() , rdd.take(5) something like that. And also can make the first 10000 line as a matrix. But I have 1.5M lines and 1200columns in the big file.  And I cannot read this as a whole matrix which I need to do  in my algorithm python code.</p><p><font size="3"><a href="../t7_a14"> Q14 </a></font>: Hi, I am looking for *basic or simple Github or Tutorials* for  *User recommendations by cosine similarity*. Any recommendations ? Thanks</p><p><font size="3"><a href="../t7_a15"> Q15 </a></font>: Does anyone have experience running pyspark jobs on an EMR cluster using spark-submit?  I have a job that hangs indefinitely in "running" mode even though it should finish in about a minute (which I know because it worked ok inside of a jupyter notebook) and would love some advice on how to debug...</p>
